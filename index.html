    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Harshini Bharanidharan</strong>, a recent <strong>MS Computer Science graduate</strong> from the University of Massachusetts Amherst with a strong focus on software development and data engineering. I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in <strong>Software Development Engineering (SDE)</strong> and <strong>Data Engineering</strong> roles, where I can build scalable systems and data pipelines that power intelligent applications.</p>

    <p>Previously, I earned my B.Tech in Information Technology from SSN College of Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in data systems, software engineering, and machine learning. Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience through roles at Freshworks, Ascendion, and ITK Education Services, where I worked on real-time ETL automation, cloud governance, cost optimization, and building full-stack applications.</p>

    <p>My work spans across technologies like <strong>Python, SQL, AWS, Docker, React, Django, MongoDB</strong>, and tools like <strong>LangChain, Streamlit, OpenAI API</strong>, and <strong>Apache Spark</strong>. I enjoy solving problems end-to-end — from designing APIs and backend systems to optimizing data pipelines and building intuitive user interfaces.</p>

    <p>I’m always open to collaborations, learning opportunities, and new challenges. Feel free to explore my projects below or reach out via LinkedIn or email!</p>
