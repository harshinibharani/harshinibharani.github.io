        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Harshini Bharanidharan. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the
            University of Massachusetts Amherst.
            My academic journey began at SSN College of Engineering in Chennai, where I earned a Bachelor of Technology
            in Information Technology with a CGPA of 9.2 out of 10. Professionally, I have worked as a Software Engineer
            at Freshworks in Chennai, where I led significant projects focused on cloud governance and compliance using
            AWS, enhancing system efficiency and reducing costs. I also interned at Ascendion, where I utilized GenAI to
            automate source-to-target data mapping, developing an automated pipeline that significantly reduced manual
            data processing time.
            My role involved extensive work with Python, Django, and JavaScript, contributing to agile development
            processes and innovative cost management solutions. My passion for technology extends beyond my professional
            and academic experiences. I am driven by the challenges of developing practical, scalable solutions that
            impact people's lives positively.
            I'm always eager to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and potential collaborators who are passionate
            about building innovative solutions. Feel free to reach out to me through any of the social links provided
            below!</p>
